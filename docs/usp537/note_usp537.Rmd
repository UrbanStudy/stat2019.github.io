## I. Introduction to Transportation Economics

### Economics problems

 - How to allocating scarce resources  
 - Between transportation and other uses  
 - Between different transportation modes  
 - Scarcity Choice Opportunity Costs  

### Transport Problems and Economic Theory

 - Consumer surplus  
 - Cost allocation models  
 - Marginal cost pricing principle  
 - Discrete choice models  

### History of Transit

 - Prior to mid-1800s: Walk
 - Mid-1800s to 1900: Horse-drawn rail
 - 1900: Electric railways
 - 1910s: Motor buses
 - 1970s: Decline of LRT
 - 1970s: Congress approves capital grants for new rail starts

### History of the Road System

1890s: interest by railroads, farmers, autos pushed for roads
1916: Federal Aid System started with $75 million for highway improvements over 5 years
1919: First state gas tax implemented
1930s: Highway improvements accelerated increased technology in trucks & buses
1944: State Interstate Highway System
1945: State highway system (90% Federally financed)

### Transportation Public Policy

 - Subsidies
   * Urban Transit (capital & operating)
   * Highway Distortions lead to
   * Problems: shifted land use
     + Opportunity cost patterns
     + Cost-effectiveness
     + Underestimation of capital cost of building and maintenance
Distortions lead to shifted land use patterns

 - Public ownership
   * Potential problems:
   * Reduced productivity and cost-effectiveness
   * Regulated high supply

Criteria for economic evaluation

 - Efficiency
 
 - Cost-effectiveness
 
 - Equity
 
## Microeconomic Foundations

### Microeconomics review

 - Supply & Demand
 - Efficiency
MC = MR
TC = FC + VC
TR = P x Q
Profit = TR – TC
Monopolist profit-maximization; deadweight loss

 - Elasticities:
Price elasticity of demand
Income elasticity of demand
Cross-price elasticity of demand

 - Demand
 
   * Law of demand: the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises, other things equal;  downward sloping
   
   * Derived from consumer utility maximization theory
   
   * Demand curve represents MB (marginal benefit)
   
   * Shifts in demand
   
   * Transportation demand
   
     + Derived demand
     
     + Time-specific

 - Supply
 
  * Law of supply: an increase in price results in an increase in quantity supplied, all else equal
  
  * Derived from producer profit maximization theory
  
  * Supply curve represents MC (marginal cost)
  
  * Shifts in supply
  
 - Elasticities:
 
  * Price elasticity of demand: percentage change of quantity demanded in response to a 1% change in price; price sensitivity of consumer demand
  
  * Income elasticity of demand
  
  * Cross-price elasticity of demand

 - Demand: MB = 10 – Q
 - Supply: MC = Q
 - Equilibrium occurs at MB = MC
 - Q* = 5 (PS) 
 - P* (market clearing price) = $5
 - What is consumer surplus (CS), producer surplus (PS) and total surplus (net benefit)?

 - Efficiency & Market Equilibrium for Monopolist
  * Demand: P = 5 – Q/1000
  * Fixed cost: FC = $5000 (each day)
  * Operating cost is $50 per hour, and can provide 100 rides
  * What is the MC? MC = $50 / 100 = $0.50
  * Total cost: TC = FC + VC = 5000 + 0.5Q
  * Total Revenue: TR = P x Q = (5 – Q/1000)Q = 5Q – Q2/1000

### Critical Issues in Transportation

 - Congestion
 - Energy, environment and climate change
 - Infrastructure
 - Finance
 - Equity
 - Emergency preparedness, response and mitigation
 - Safety
 - Institutions
 - Human and intellectual capital
 - Reliability & resilience of transportation systems
 - Safety
 - Energy, environment and climate
 - Infrastructure funding

### Microeconomics Review

 - Demand: shifts caused by income, price of other goods and services (complements and substitutes), tastes/trends, expectation of future price changes
  * Demand for transport is a derived demand

  * It is time-specific

  * Follows peaks and troughs throughout day, season, week, etc.

 - Supply: 
 
shifts caused by cost of production, government policy, price of related goods, natural shocks, technology


 - Elasticities: 

Effects of changes in tolls, transit fares, congestion pricing, fuel price
On VMT, # of cars, # of trips, trips on public transit, fuel consumption, vehicle fuel economy



 - Example:
 
Demand: P = 5 – Q/1000

Fixed cost: FC = $5000 (each day)

Operating cost is $50 per hour, and can provide 100 rides  what is the MC? MC = $50 / 100 =

$0.50

Total cost: TC = FC + VC = 5000 + 0.5Q

Total Revenue: TR = P x Q = (5 – Q/1000)Q = 5Q – Q^2/1000

  a). What is the equilibrium number of rides if price is set at MC? MR = MC (marginal revenue is P in perfect competition!)
  
5 – Q/1000 = 0.50

Q* = 4500

What is the TC? TR? Profit?

TC = 5000 + 0.5(4500) = 5000 + 2250 = 7250

TR = 0.50 * 4500 = 2250

Profit = 2250 – 7250 = -$5000 (negative!! Which equates to a subsidy for a publicly owned agency)

  b). Elasticity between (P,Q) = (1,4000) to (2, 3000)? How to interpret it?

  c). If the operator is a monopolist, what is the P, Q, profit and deadweight loss?

MR = derivative of TR = 5 – Q/500 (law of demand!)

MR = MC to decide profit-maximizing quantity ; 5 – Q/500 = 0.50 ; Qm = 2250 

P is determined with demand function; P = 5 – 2250/1000 = $2.75

DWL = 0.5 * 2.25 * 1750 = $1968.75

Profit = (2.75*2250) - (5000 + 0.5*2250) = $62.50



## II. Demand for Transportation

### Types of Demand

 - When to travel
 - To what destination
 - What mode of transportation
 - What route to take

### Choices impacting transportation demand

 - Decisions made by organizations
 - Decisions made by households or individuals
 - Complexities
  * Interrelated decisions
  * Spatial and temporal
  * Quality of service
  * Derived demand
  * Supply and demand interactions via congestion
  * Heterogeneity

### Transportation demand and Economic Development

 - “Chicken or the egg”?
 - Supply led view transportation; economic development
 - Demand led view Economic development; transportation

### Aggregate Demand Models

#### Income elasticities of motor vehicle ownership
 - Vehicle ownership
  * Population density elasticity of vehicle ownership= -0.4 (urban) & -0.1 (national)
  * Spatial spread of economic activity
  * Urban: density ↔ motorization
  * National: urbanization ↔ income
  
#### Income elasticities of road length
 - Road length
  * F(size of economy, geographical area, population, income per capital, population density)
  * Population density elasticity of road length

#### Case Study 1 Demand for gas and automobile travel
  
 - Gt = f(Real Gas Price, Real Personal Income, Population, Season, Gasoline Crisis)
Hypotheses:

  * Law of demand
  * Opportunity cost = real gas price + queuing cost
  * Gasoline is normal good
  * Market demand is horizontal sum of individual demands
  
#### Case Study #2 – Demand for urban rail rapid transit
  
 - Estimation results
  
### Disaggregate Demand Models

#### Random Utility Model (RUM)  

 - Systematic component
 - Random component

 - Example:
Two choices – auto or bus

If Ubus > Uauto, choose bus
If Ubus < Uauto, choose auto

#### Binomial Probit

 - Lave (1969) estimation on Chicago commuters:

#### Logit

 - McFadden et al. (1977)
 
multinomial logit for urban work trips

auto, bus/walk, bus/auto, carpool

V = -0.0412c/w – 0.0201t – 0.0531t0 – 0.89 D1 – 1.78 D3 – 2.15 D4

  * What is the probability of each mode (mode share)?
  
  * Assumption: Independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA)

#### Logit Example

V = -0.0412c/w – 0.0201t – 0.0531t0 – 0.89 D1 – 1.78 D3 – 2.15 D4

What are the mode splits estimated by this model?

#### Nested Logit

 - Lam and Small (2001)
 
  * Choices not hierarchical
  * Simultaneous
  * Allows correlation between choices in same nest

V = -0.874 Dtag+ 0.0239 IncDtag–0.767 ForLangDtag–0.785 Dlane–0.356 c –0.150 t –0.217 R + other terms
