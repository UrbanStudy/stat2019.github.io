RE: How Bay Area should be planning for autonomous vehicles?

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary}}

This memo is one of the series of policy analysis about autonomous
vehicles for Bay Area. It trys to answer how the autonomous vehicles
will affect urban land use, and What the MPO and cities should be
planning to seize this opportunity and address the challenges.

\section{Background: Explains the current and projected status of
AVs.}\label{background-explains-the-current-and-projected-status-of-avs.}}

\emph{Technology}: The history of exploring autonomous vehicles can date
back to late 1950s ({\textbf{???}}). Since DARPA ran the Grand Challenge
in 2004, the autonomous vehicle technologies entered a ``critical
juncture.'' (Docherty, Marsden, and Anable 2018) In the fields of
automation control systems, some critical hardwares like processors and
sensors are having the ability of undertaking more complex tasks. The
improving softwares and algorithm are becoming more fledged. According
the definition and taxonomy by (international 2018), the existing
technologies are achiving from the Level 3 - Conditional Driving
Automation to Level 4 - High Driving Automation.\footnote{SAE defines
  the concept of AV as ADS-DV (ADS-Dedicated Vehicle), ``A vehicle
  designed to be operated exclusively by a level 4 or level 5 ADS for
  all trips within its given Operational Design Domain (ODD)
  limitations.'' ADS means ``The hardware and software that are
  collectively capable of performing the entire Dynamic Driving Task
  (DDT) on a sustained basis, regardless of whether it is limited to a
  specific ODD; this term is used specifically to describe a level 3, 4,
  or 5 driving automation system.''}

\emph{Industry}: Since 2009, Google had conducted a series of tests for
AVs over 10 million miles on real-world roads in California, Texas, and
other states. Waymo, a company founded by Google, hold the only testing
permit for driverless testing by California DMV and committed to
providing a ride-hailing services in Arizona in 2018. In 2019 Waymo
announced their Level 4 AV will be assembled in Detroit. Almost all big
automakers such as Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, etc., are investing
heavily in this field.{[}Fagnant \& kockelman, 2015{]} The leading
transportation network companys (TNC) like Uber and Lyft are making up a
term of transportation-as-a-service (Taas) to change current travel
modes by AVs.

\emph{Academia}: Many scholars start working on the reaserch of AVs with
lots of energy. Gandia et al. (2019)`s reserch found 10580 published
papers in this field from 1945 to 2018. Since 2012, the number of
articles have an exponential growth with 39\% growth rate while 8-9\%
average growth rate in science. Although a large amount of the research
are from the perspective of systems control, computer science, robotics,
engineering, there are more and more articls that start to focus on the
AVs' impact on transportation and Land use.

\emph{Governavce}: In 2011, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles
issued a first license to google's experimental AVs. Currently, 22
states have passed legislation related to AV. Governors in 10 states
have issued executive orders related to autonomous vehicles.

On Sep.~12, the National Highway and Transportation Safety
Administration (NHTSA) released new federal guidelines for Automated
Driving Systems (ADS). A Vision for Safety 2.0, the latest guidance for
automated driving systems to industry and the states. The guidance
builds on NHTSA's 2016 guidance.USDOT,

California is playing a leading role in this field. Until January 2019,
California DMV has issued AV Testing Permits (with a driver) to 62
companies on public roadways.

(Milakis, Van Arem, and Van Wee 2017) Many substantial implications of
autonomous vehicles are not considered in this memo, such as safety,
liability, and etc. {[}riple effects{]}. This analysis focus on the
impact on land use, wich have short-term and long-term influences. The
short-term influences include che change of parking, urban design,
affected by travel demand and behavior

The long-term influences include the reconstructure of urban forms and
