### Accessibility measures for regional transportation planning. 

Choose a metropolitan area. This could be the same one that you use for your case study assignment. Imagine that they are going to update their regional transportation plan, along with their processes for selecting projects for funding, at all scales. The staff wants to incorporate measures of accessibility into decision making and needs the MPO board to agree. Prepare a memo for the MPO board that does the following:

Explains and defines accessibility, including why it should be used in transportation decision making


Defines different options for measuring accessibility for use in the regional transportation plan, as well as at the project level (e.g. new roadway capacity, transit infrastructure, bike/pedestrian infrastructure, demand and system management projects, etc.).
Evaluates the accessibility measures. You evaluation should use clear criteria and draw on existing sources.
Discusses how equity could be incorporated in the accessibility measures. In doing so, how are you defining equity?

### Autonomous vehicles and land use. Choose a metropolitan area. 

This could be the same one that you use for your case study assignment. Imagine that you have been asked by the MPO to provide advice on how the MPO, as well as the cities within the region, should be planning for autonomous vehicles. Prepare a memo that does the following:

Explains the current and projected status of AVs
Discusses how AVs could influence demand for transportation and, in turn land use. For this analysis, use both theory and research.
Identifies the benefits and costs of these possible outcomes.
Presents policy and planning options for mitigating or otherwise addressing the possible land use effects.
Discusses how the MPO and cities may need alter the tools and analyses they use to consider AVs.
This memo is just one of a series that the MPO is commissioning on this topic. Therefore, your memo should focus on land use (broadly defined, including housing, parking, urban design). Other memos will covers topics related to AVS such as safety and liability.
