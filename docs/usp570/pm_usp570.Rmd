RE: How Bay Area should be planning for autonomous vehicles? 


# Summary

This memo is one of the series of policy analysis about autonomous vehicles for Bay Area. It trys to answer how the autonomous vehicles will affect urban land use, and What the MPO and cities should be planning to seize this opportunity and address the challenges.

# Background: Explains the current and projected status of AVs.

USDOT

Ca DMV

Waymoo and others

Taas

# Changes: Discusses how AVs could influence demand for transportation and, in turn land use. For this analysis, use both theory and research.

## focus on relevant changes

Many substantial implications of autonomous vehicles are not considered in this memo, such as safety, liability, and etc. [riple effects]. This analysis focus on the impact on land use, wich have short-term and long-term influences. The short-term influences include che change of parking, urban design, affected by travel demand and behavior

The long-term influences include the reconstructure of urban forms and spatial distributions.

## essence

Four stage

Theory: bid-rent theroy, utility maximize.

Research: Identifies the benefits and costs of these possible outcomes.

focus on Characteristic: 

cut off labor cost, 

round-the-clock services.

full ridesharing by realtime matching

## Methodology


high risk in use sufficient principle, and likelihood principle. another option is convariance principle.

Internet, Air Transport system, TNC

## inference: 

previous reaserch had give many estimation of the change on road capacities, parking lots, curve space.

use cost and transaction costs - full match

deals fail




# The short-term Respose

Presents policy and planning options for mitigating or otherwise addressing the possible land use effects.

designating pilot area


## housing, 

## parking, 

## urban design


# The strategic planning

Discusses how the MPO and cities may need alter the tools and analyses they use to consider AVs.

Zoning, Division, and partion, not uniform 

# Conclusion

overestimated and under estimate
