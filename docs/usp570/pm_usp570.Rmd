RE: How Bay Area should be planning for autonomous vehicles? 


# Summary

This memo is one of the series of policy analysis about autonomous vehicles for Bay Area. It trys to answer how the autonomous vehicles will affect urban land use, and What the MPO and cities should be planning to seize this opportunity and address the challenges.

# Background: the current and projected status of AVs.

*Technology*: The history of exploring autonomous vehicles can date back to late 1950s [@milakis2019long]. Since DARPA ran the Grand Challenge in 2004, the autonomous vehicle technologies entered a "critical juncture." [@docherty2018governance] In the fields of automation control systems, some critical hardwares like processors and sensors are having the ability of undertaking more complex tasks. The improving softwares and algorithm are becoming more fledged. According the definition and taxonomy by @sae2018taxonomy, the existing technologies are achiving from the Level 3 - Conditional Driving Automation to Level 4 - High Driving Automation. [^AV]

[^AV]: SAE defines the concept of AV as ADS-DV (ADS-Dedicated Vehicle), "A vehicle designed to be operated exclusively by a level 4 or level 5 ADS for all trips within its given Operational Design Domain (ODD) limitations." 
ADS means "The hardware and software that are collectively capable of performing the entire Dynamic Driving Task (DDT) on a sustained basis, regardless of whether it is limited to a specific ODD; this term is used specifically to describe a level 3, 4, or 5 driving automation system."


*Industry*: Since 2009, Google had conducted a series of tests for AVs over 10 million miles on real-world roads in California, Texas, and other states. Waymo, a company founded by Google, hold the only testing permit for driverless testing by California DMV and committed to providing a ride-hailing services in Arizona in 2018. In 2019, Waymo announced their Level 4 AV will be assembled in Detroit. Almost all big automakers such as Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, etc., are investing heavily in this field.[Fagnant & kockelman, 2015] The leading transportation network companys (TNC) like Uber and Lyft are making up a term of transportation-as-a-service (Taas) to change current travel modes by AVs.

*Academia*: Many scholars start working on the reaserch of AVs with lots of energy. @gandia2019autonomous's reserch found 10580 published papers in this field from 1945 to 2018. Since 2012, the number of articles have an exponential growth with 39% growth rate while 8-9% average growth rate in science. Although a large amount of the research are from the perspective of systems control, computer science, robotics, engineering, there are more and more articls that start to focus on the AVs' impact on transportation and Land use.

*Governavce*: In 2011, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles issued a first license to google's experimental AVs. Currently, “33 states have passed legislation related to AV.” “15 states enacted 18 AV related bills.” [@NCSL2019AV]
From 2016 to 2018 the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S.DOT) and the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) published three federal guidences for Automated Driving Systems (ADS is the definition by SAE). The guidances advocate industry, state and local government to support the AVs' development. [@NHTSA2019ADS]
California is playing a leading role in this field. Until January 2019, California DMV has issued AV Testing Permits (with a driver) to 62 companies on public roadways.


# Changes: unveiling the future

There are some indications that a new era might be dawning. We want to knwow how AVs could influence demand for transportation and land use? This memo will focus on the crutial response for land use. The topic of safety, liability, and other issues will discussed in other memos. 

## Framwork

While industry, scholars and governments realized the high impact of AV, some research frameworks also imply it is a highly uncertainly evolution rising up some complex issues such as coupling, resonance, or agitation.
@milakis2017policy arrange many substantial implications of autonomous vehicles by a structure of [riple effects], whcih reflected a sequantially spreading process. Land use is placed in the second-order that is affected by the factors in the first-order including travel cost, travel time, vehicle use, capacity, trvael modes, and etc. The flaw of this structure is that the ripple effects model emphasizes the diffusion characteristic of the AV technology and cannot describe the feedback effects, the changes of real estate and land use will influence the travel behavior and traffic in the first-order too. The Diamond of Assembly [@levinson2018metropolitan Chapter.12] and the feedback cylce [@wegener2004land; adaped by @soteropoulos2019impacts] are two helpful complements. These figures can present the relationship between transportation and land use in a more clear manner. AV technology as a exogenous variable will influence travel behaviors in the first ripple, and then is reflected in the change of accessiblity.

Theory: 

@Muller2017transportation introduces the four stages in the spatial evolution of the American metropolitan. Form to , the four-stage model shows that each "break through in movement technology" had reshaped the previous dominated urban form and launched a new era with a "distinctive spatial structure". This history tells us, under the assumption of AV being a breakthrough forces, many previous models, methods, and arguments will fail. We have to review the classical theories before getting some quick answers.

*The utility maximization problem*: As the core of consumer theory.


Cost-benifit

bid-rent theroy, 

Research: Identifies the benefits and costs of these possible outcomes.

focus on Characteristic: 

cut off labor cost, 

round-the-clock services.

full ridesharing by realtime matching

Time cost [@singleton2019discussing]



## The relevant researches



the impact on land use, wich have short-term and long-term influences. The short-term influences include che change of parking, urban design, affected by travel demand and behavior

The long-term influences include the reconstructure of urban forms and spatial distributions.








## Methodology

convergent


high risk in use sufficient principle, and likelihood principle. another option is convariance principle.

Internet, Air Transport system, TNC

## inference: 

Behavior and land use [@soteropoulos2019impacts]

[@hawkins2019integrated]

previous reaserch had give many estimation of the change on road capacities, parking lots, curve space.

use cost and transaction costs - full match

deals fail




# The short-term Respose

[@legacy2019planning]

Presents policy and planning options for mitigating or otherwise addressing the possible land use effects.

designating pilot area


## housing, 

## parking, 

## urban design


# The strategic planning

long-term effects [@milakis2019long]

Discusses how the MPO and cities may need alter the tools and analyses they use to consider AVs.

Zoning, Division, and partion, not uniform 

# Conclusion

overestimated and under estimate

from link to node

CA should play a leading role. responsibility
