  The `Diamond of Design'
\end{itemize}

Levinson and Krizek (2018 Chapter.11) introduced a new `Diamond', a
structure of four key design tenents-hierarchy, morphology, layers, and
architectural content. Here author define the term `design' as ``how
elements of place and plexus arrange their parts into a whole on a
variety of scales, from the neighborhood to the metropolis.'' This
framework even coveres the cities system as a high-level hierarchy
place. This perspective is more from engineering or computer science.
The author compare the layers of place and plexus with the OSI (Open
Systems Interconnetion) Model, a computer networking framwork. This view
point is different with the planner who have design background but it
provide a powerful tools to explain the complexity of urban land use and
transportation.

  Objectively measure subjective qualities
\end{itemize}

The study by Ewing et al. (2006) attempts to quantitatively measure five
urban design qualities in terms of physical characteristics of street.
This reaserch try to answer two questions: 1. Which urban design
qualities have significant effects on the average value of walkability
and how much are the effects ? 2. Which physical features have
significant effects on the average scores of urban design qulities and
how much are the effects?

The research team select nine from 51 perceptual qualities, 48 from more
than video clips, and selest 10 urban design and planning experts. The
expert panel are invloved in defining the `operational' and give the
walkability ratings for each clips and assign a score for each quality
on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high).

This study used the fractional factorial design, the crossed multilevel
Design, random effects models, and linear regression models to built up
the relationship among physical teatures, urban design qulities ad
overall walkability.

At the end the team dropped four qualities and choose imageability,
enclosure, human scale, and transparency as the measurement of
walkability. This study found that 38 of more than 130 physical features
have significant effects on one or more perceptual qualities. In a later
paper, Ewing and Handy (2009) gave all the consensus qualitaitive
definiations and operational definitions for each qualities and identify
detailed physical features associated with each qualitty

  Discussion: predetermined or prior information.
\end{itemize}

In the part of experiment design, research team define their purpose are
``trying to operationalize design concepts, not assess public
preferences''. They believe ``average person'' cannot rate streetscapes
as to their ``legibility,'' ``transparency,'' and so on. The selection
of video clips is also to match the perceptual qualities. At the end,
this study use five criteria to examine which urban design qualities are
more amenable and would be defined operationally in the field survey
instrument. The criteria include the significant level in regression
models, the ICC (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient reflects the
proportion of the variance of an observation that is the result of
differences between treatments) and Variance Components in random
effects models. Technically, this reaserch is for comparing which
qualities are more operational rather than proving the relationship
between walkability and physical features.

The part of the fractional factorial design (FFD) is puzzling. FFD is
for simplify and improve experiment.\footnote{``A major use of
  fractional factorials is in screening experiments---experiments in
  which many factors are considered and the objective is to identify
  those factors that have large effects. Screening experiments are
  usually performed in the early stages of a project when many of the
  factors initially considered likely have little or no effect on the
  response. The factors identified as important are then investigated
  more thoroughly in subsequent experiments.''} The \(2^{8-4}\) FFD
means k=8 factors, p=4 independent generators and 48 observations can
assign each of 16 runs with 3 replication. Properly choosing the
generators make the effects of potential interest are not aliased with
each other. The result of FFD should tell us which factors and
interactions are improtant and negligible. However, the papar don't
provide the list of generators and alias, don't clarify which factors
are confounded and which factors and interaction have significant
effects.

On the contrary, this reaserch use FFD as a method of sample selection.
``The \(2^{8-4}\) sample allowed us to capture the main effects of each
urban design quality on overall walkability,\ldots{}to maximize
geographic diversity.'' (Clemente and Ewing 2005) Actually, what this
step do is not sample selection, is treatment selecetion. The 48 clips
are be rated by viewer in the next step. Moreover, a significant
interaction will often mask the significance of main effects. In the
presence of significant interaction, the experimenter must usually
examine the levels of one factor, say A, with levels of the other
factors fixed to draw conclusions about the main effect of A.

The 48 clips are selceted to match the selection of qualities. The
raters have simular opinions on them, and highly consistent with
previous literatures. Both of the viewers and the scenes are not
randomly selected. The relationship about qualities and walkability are
predetermined. It just prove some qualities are more measurable than
others.

It is not strange that ``eight of the nine qualities were collinear.
Tolerance values were unacceptably low when all variables were included
in a regression at once.'' In this situation, we cannont extend the
conclusions to all treatments in the population.

To examine the true relationship

``The Bayesian paradigm prescribes that the sample information
\(f(\vec x|\theta)\) be combined with the prior information
\(\pi(\theta)\) using Bayes' Theorem to obtain the posterior
distribution \(\pi(\theta|\vec x)\). All inferences about \(\theta\) are
now based on the posterior distribution.''
