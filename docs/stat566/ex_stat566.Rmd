 - If the response values (or mean response with number of replications) of a 2k factorial design are given, then be able to
compute estimated value of any effect,

|  ---  |   --- | ---| ---
|main    |$A=\frac12(-\bar y_{(1)}+\bar y_a-\bar y_b+\bar y_{ab})$|$SS_B=\frac{n}4C_B^2=\frac{n}4(-\bar y_{(1)}-\bar y_a+\bar y_b+\bar y_{ab})^2$|The average amount of impurities remaining in the material washed increase by 5.15 grams as the temperatures changes from low to high.
|interaction|$AB=\frac12(\bar y_{(1)}-\bar y_a-\bar y_b+\bar y_{ab})$|$SS_{AB}=\frac{n}4C_{AB}^2=\frac{n}4(\bar y_{(1)}-\bar y_a-\bar y_b+\bar y_{ab})^2$|The change in average amount of impurities remaining in the material washed when the temperatures changes from low to high at long wsahing time is smaller by 2.75 grams than short washing time. 



 - If the table of estimated effects and the corresponding half normal probability plot (without any labels of effects) of any single replicated 2k-p design are given, then be able to
decide which effects are non-negligible,

Based on the normal QQ plot, only the effects of $A, B, AB$ are non-negligible. The reset factors gather around the quantile-quantile line. The effects or interaction effects of rest factors are negligible.

Form the half-normal quantiles plot, D effects is non-negligible after estimating all effects.

Based on the ANOVA table, all the P-value are larger than 0.05. There is no factor has significant effects at 5% significance level.

Based on ANOVA table, factor C, AB, AC, BC have significant effects on average value of y at 0.05 significance level. Their P-values are 0.01391,0.009613, 0.0009777, 0.006712 respectivly. That means, effect of class of mail, type of mail, and offered price on average number of orders are not independent. Therefore, simple effects examinations are recommended.

Based on the ANOVA table, the effects of pH (factor D) and cooler (block) on average shelf life of yogurt are significant at 5% significance level.

The change in average number of orders placed when the brochure is black-and-white at 1st class is smaller by 5.00 than 3rd class at 0.05 significance level (P-value=0.0149155).

 - If the treatment assignment of blocks in a 2k factorial with 2p blocks design, then find out and list all the effects confounded with blocks.

A $2^4$ factorial experiment is to be conducted in 4 blocks with ABC interaction and BCD interaction effects are confounded with incomplete blocks with single replication.

$ABC\times BCD=AB^2C^2D=AD$ is confounded with incomplete blocks automatically.
