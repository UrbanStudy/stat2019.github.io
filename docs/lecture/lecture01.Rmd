### 1. 
1. Definition: An **experiment** is a process that leads to one of several possible outcomes.
    
1. Definition: The **sample space** (S) is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

1. Definition: An **event** is a subset of S

- subset
- intersection
- union
- Complemnet of A
- empty set
---
### 2. 
1. Definition: A and B are _disjiont or mutually exclusive_, if $A\cup B=\emptyset$

1. Let B be a subset of all possible subset of S. Then B is a **Borel field** or a $\sigma$-algebra, if
    (1). $A\cup B=\emptyset$
    (2). if $A\in B, then\ A^c\in B$
    (3). if $\{A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},...\}\subset B, then\ \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\in B$
### 3. Kolmugorov axious/properties
let B be a **Borel field**. Then P is a **probability set function** if
    (1). $\forall A\in B,\ P(A)\ge0$
    (2). $P(S)=1$
    (3). $If A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},...are\ pairavise\ disjoint, then\ P(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_i)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}P(A_{i})$

### 4. Example
Roll a 6-sides die $S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$

  $B=\{\emptyset ,S,\{1,2\},\{3,4,5,6\}\}$ 
is a well-defined **Borel field**
  
Define：
  $P(A)=\begin{cases}1&if\ 2\in A \\o &otherwise\end{cases}$ 
This is a well-defined **probability function**
  
Define: 
  $P(A)=\frac{element in A}{6}$ 
This is also a well-defined **probability function**

# Why Regression Analysis?

- Regression analysis allows scientists to quantify how the average of one variable systematically varies according to the levels of another variable;
- Comparing with hypothesis testing techinque we reviewed before, additional variables can be introduced into regression models to help to determine if a relationship is genuine or spurious;
- Regression models also allow scientists to examine the mechanisms that their theories and ideas suggest explain the association between a particular predictor variable and an outcome;
- Regression models can be used to examine how two predictors jointly associate with an outcome variable;
- Regression models can be used for predictions or scenario analysis.
