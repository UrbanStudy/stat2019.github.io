**2.24** Compute E X and Var X for eaCh of the following probability distributions.

(a) $f_X(x)=ax^{a-1}, 0<x<1, a>0$

(b) $fx(x)=\frac1n,\ x=1,2,..., n, n>0$ an integer

(c) $fx(x)=\frac32(x-1)^2, 0<X<2$



**2.28** Let $\mu_n$ denote the nth central moment of a random variable X. Two quantities of
interest, in addition to the mean and variance, are

$$\alpha_3=\frac{\mu_3}{(\mu_2)^{3/2}}\ and\ \alpha_4=\frac{\mu_4}{\mu_2^2}$$

The value $\alpha_3$ is called the _skewness_ and $\alpha_4$ is called the _kurtosis_. The skewness measures
the lack of symmetry in the pdf (see Exercise 2.26). The kurtosis, although harder to
interpret, measures the peakedness or flatness of the pdf.

(a) Show that if a pdf is symmetric about a point a, then $\alpha_3=O$.

(b) Calculate $\alpha_3$ as for $f(x)=e^{-x}$, a pdf that is skewed to the right.

(c) Calculate $\alpha_4$ for each of the following pdfs and comment on the peakedness .of
each.

$$f(x)=\frac1{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-x^2/2},-\infty<x<\infty$$

$$f(x)=\frac12,-1<x<1$$

$$f(x)=\frac12e^{-|x|},-\infty<x<\infty$$

Ruppert (1987) uses influence functions (see Miscellanea 10.6.4) to explore further the
meaning of kurtosis, and Groeneveld (1991) uses them to explore skewness; see also
Balanda and MacGillivray (1988) for more on the interpreta.tion of $\alpha_4$.

**2.33** In each of the following cases verify the expression given for the moment generating
function, and in each case use the mgf to calculate E X and Var X.

(a) $P(X=x)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\ \lambda^x}{x}, M_X(t)=e^{\lambda(e^t-1)}, x=0,1,...; \lambda>0$

(b) $P(X=x)=p(1-p)^x, M_X(t)=\frac{p}{1-(1-p)e^t}, x=0,1,...; 0<p<1$

(c) $f_X(x)=\frac{e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma},\quad M_X(t)=e^{\mu t+\sigma^2t^2/2}, -\infty<x<\infty; -\infty<\mu<\infty, \sigma>0$
