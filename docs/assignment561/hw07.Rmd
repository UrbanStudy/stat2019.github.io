**3.28** Show that each of the following families is an exponential family.

(a) normal family with either parameter $\mu$ or $\sigma$ known

****
(b) gamma family with either parameter $\alpha$ or $\beta$ known or both unknown

****
(c) beta family with either parameter $\alpha$ or $\beta$ known or both unknown

****
(d) Poisson family

****
(e) negative binomial family with r known, 0<p<1

**3.33** For each of the following families:

(i) Verify that it is an exponential family.

(ii) Describe the curve on which the 9 parameter vector lies.

(iii) Sketch a graph of the curved parameter space.

(a) $n(\theta, \theta)$

****
(b) $n(\theta, a\theta)$, a known

****
(c) gamma($\alpha, 1/\alpha$)

****
(d) $f(x|\theta) = C exp (-(x-\theta)^4)$ , C a normalizing constant

**3.38** Let Z be a random variable with pdf f(z). Define $z_{\alpha}$ to be a number that satisfies this relationship:
$$\alpha= P ( Z > z_{\alpha}) =\int_{z_{\alpha}}^{\infty}f(z)dz.$$
Show that if X is a random variable with pdf ($l/\sigma)f((x-\mu)/\sigma$) and $x_{\alpha}=\sigma z_{\alpha}+\mu$, then $P(X>x_{\alpha})=\alpha$. (Thus if a table of $z_{\alpha}$ values were available, then values of $x_{\alpha}$ could be easily computed for any member of the location-scale family.)

According to Theorem 3.5.6, f(x) is pdf, $\mu,\sigma\in\mathbf{R}$, $\sigma>0$. X is a random variable with pdf ($l/\sigma)f((x-\mu)/\sigma$) when and only when Z is a random variable with pdf f(z) and $X=\sigma Z+\mu$

$$\therefore P(X>x_{\alpha})=P(\sigma Z+\mu>\sigma z_{\alpha}+\mu)= P(Z>z_{\alpha})=\alpha $$
