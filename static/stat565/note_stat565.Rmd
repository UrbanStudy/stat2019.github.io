## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Strategy of Experimentation

### 1.2 Some Typical Applications of Experimental Design

 - Characterizing a Process
 - Optimizing a Process
 - Designing a Product
 - Formulating a Product
 - Designing a Web Page

### 1.3 Basic Principles

 - randomization: both the allocation of the experimental material and the order in which the individual runs of the experiment are to be performed are randomly determined.
 - replication: an independent repeat run of each factor combination. replication $\neq$ repeated measurements.
 - blocking: a design technique used to improve the precision with which comparisons among the factors of
interest are made.
 - factorial

### 1.4 Guidelines for Designing Experiments

 1. Recognition of and statement of the problem.
 2. Selection of the response variable.
 3. Choice of factors, levels, and range.
  - potential design factors
   + design factors
   + held-constant factors
   + allowed-to-vary factors
  - nuisance factors
   + controllable factors
   + uncontrollable factors
   + noise factors
 4. Choice of experimental design
 5. Performing the experiment
 6. Statistical analysis of the data
 7. Conclusions and recommendations
 
### 1.5 A Brief History of Statistical Design

### 1.6 Summary: Using Statistical Techniques in Experimentation

 1. Use your nonstatistical knowledge of the problem
 2. Keep the design and analysis as simple as possible
 3. Recognize the difference between practical and statistical significance
 4. Experiments are usually iterative

### 2.1 Introduction

**Theorem 2-1** The Central Limit Theorem (p.31)

If $y_1, y_2,.., y_n$ is a sequence of n independent and identically distributed random variables with $E(y_i)=\mu$ and $V(y_i)=\sigma^2$ (both finite) and $x=y_1 + y_2 +..+y_n$, then the limiting form of the distribution of
$$Z_n=\frac {x − n\mu}{\sqrt{n\sigma^2}}$$
as $n\to\infty$ is the standard normal distribution.
