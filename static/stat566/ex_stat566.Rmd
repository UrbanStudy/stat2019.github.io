Based on ANOVA table, factor AB, AC, BC have significant effects on average value of y at 0.05 significance level. Their P-values  respectivly. That means, effect of A, B, and C on average number of orders are not independent. Therefore, simple effects examinations are recommended.

Based on the ANOVA table, the effects of factor D and block on average value of y are significant at 5% significance level.

a contrast statement for the four factor interaction effect using standard order of letters.

$ABCD=\bar y_{(1)}-\bar y_a-\bar y_b+\bar y_{ab}-\bar y_c+\bar y_{ac}+\bar y_{bc}-\bar y_{abc}-\bar y_d+\bar y_{ad}+\bar y_{bd}+\bar y_{cd}-\bar y_{abd}-\bar y_{acd}-\bar y_{bcd}+\bar y_{abcd}$

the single replicated $2^3$ factorial design with ABC confounded with two blocks, $p=1$. 
Each block have 4 observations. The ABC interaction is defined as the average difference between the BC interaction at the two different levels of A.

$SS_{ABC}=\sum_i^2\sum_j^2\sum_k^2(\hat\tau\hat\beta\hat\gamma)_{ijk}^2=2^3(\frac{-y_{111}+y_{211}+y_{121}-y_{221}+y_{112}-y_{212}-y_{122}+y_{222}}{2^3})^2$

$=\frac1{2^3}(-y_{(1)}+ y_{a}+y_{b}- y_{ab}+ y_{c}- y_{ac}- y_{bc}+ y_{abc})^2=\frac{1}{2^3}C_{ABC}^2$

$SS_{Block}=\sum_i^2\sum_j^2\sum_k^2\sum_l^2\hat\delta_l^2=2^2(\delta_1^2+\delta_2^2)=2^2[(\bar y_{blk1}-\bar y_{...})^2+(\bar y_{blk2}-\bar y_{...})^2]$

$=2^2[(-\frac18C_{ABC})^2+(\frac18C_{ABC})^2]=\frac1{2^3}C_{ABC}^2=SS_{ABC}$
