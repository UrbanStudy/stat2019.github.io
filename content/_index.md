title: "Applied Regression Analysis"
description: "Basic concepts of regression analysis, matrix approach to linear regression selecting the “best” regression equation, and multiple regression. Computational algorithms and computer software regression packages. Applications in science, engineering,and business. 
*Overall course goals:*
In this course we focus on learning the various mathematical and statistical criteria used to build models, find the “best model”, check for model adequacy, alleviate, if possible, the problems so as to improve the model adequacy, estimate the parameters (quantities) of interest, and predict future outcomes. The corresponding formal tests of statistical inference are discussed. Case studies via computer application are used to motivate and illustrate the various techniques."

### Prerequisites: 

Mth 261 and either Stat 451/Stat 551 or Stat 461/Stat 561.

### Attendance: 

Students are required to attend all lectures in order to be successful in the course. If you happen to miss class, it is your responsibility to retrieve what you missed.

### Lectures:

Lecture handouts are incorporated in all lectures. Incomplete handouts will be posted on D2L/ Content weekly. Students are encouraged to bring these to class, and complete those and/or make additional notes. You should know what is not on your lecture notes during the class. Lecture notes are not a substitution for lecture, reading assignments, and homework. They are intended to be guide line for the text, outlining some important topics in each section.

### Statistical Software and Lab

Students have the freedom to use SAS or R (and RStudio). SAS is not free to download and is available in the BDWY225, DF001, and URBN computer labs at PSU. Also, if you take your personal computer to Office of Information Technology (OIT) at room 18 (basement level) of SMSU, you can get SAS installed for free. R (and RStudio) is a free software and available in all the computer labs at PSU as well as to download for free. You can use the computers in this lab (DF 1) when there is no session. The schedule of this computer lab is available at http://www.pdx.edu/math/math-computer-lab-schedule.
