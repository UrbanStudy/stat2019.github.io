- (In order to receive a Pass with the Pass/No Pass option, a grade of C or better must be earned. A grade of C- is NOT a passing grade.)
- Based on the overall grade (%) the letter grade will be assigned according to Table 2 after rounding your grade properly. 

### Academic Integrity Policy

Students are expected to adhere to guidelines concerning academic dishonesty outlined in University’s Student Code of Conduct (http://www.pdx.edu/dos/psu-student-code-conduct). Students are encouraged to contact the instructor for clarification of these guidelines if they have questions or concerns. You (students) are encouraged to work together on homework and SPSS lab problems, but the work you turn in must be your own (unless the assignment specifically states otherwise). Work on the exams and quizzes must be your own. Any act of academic dishonesty will result in a score of zero on the item in question and notification of department and university officials. Further action may be taken as warranted. Subsequent offenses will result in an F in the class.

### Disturbances: 

Classroom disturbances that impede on other students’ opportunity to learn will not be tolerated. Disturbers will first be asked to stop. If the disturbance continues, the student will be asked to leave class.

###	Disabilities

If you have, or think you may have, a disability that may affect your work in this class and feel you need accommodations, contact the Disability Resource Center to schedule an appointment and initiate a conversation about reasonable accommodations. The DRC is located in 116 Smith Memorial Student Union, 503-725-4150, drc@pdx.edu, http://www.pdx.edu/drc.
- If you already have accommodations, please contact me to make sure that I have received a faculty notification letter and discuss your accommodations.
- Students who need accommodations for tests and quizzes are expected to schedule their tests to overlap with the time the class is taking the test.
- Please be aware that the accessible tables or chairs in the room should remain available for students who find that standard classroom seating is not useable.
- For information about emergency preparedness, please go to the Fire and Life Safety webpage (http://www.pdx.edu/environmental-health-safety/fire-and-life-safety) for information.

###	Title IX Reporting Obligations:
As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment for my students and for the campus as a whole. As a member of the university community, I have the responsibility to report any instances of sexual harassment, sexual violence and/or other forms of prohibited discrimination. If you would rather share information about sexual harassment, sexual violence or discrimination to a confidential employee who does not have this reporting responsibility, you can find [a list](http://www.pdx.edu/sexual-assault/get-help) of those individuals. For more information about Title IX please complete the required student module [Creating a Safe Campus](http://www.pdx.edu/sexual-assault/safe-campus-module) in your D2L.
